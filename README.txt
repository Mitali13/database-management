Description : The topic for my miniproject in this 3rd semester is Departmental Store Management i.e, a type of Database Management. In the project here I have made the use of appropriate data structures required. The files are handled as needed. It can add elements to the list, edit the elements, delete an element, display all the items in the list, billing the required elements and viewing the sales all at once. These programs are very useful in storing all data in one place in shops like grocery shop, accessory shop or clothing shops too.
